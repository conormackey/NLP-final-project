# NLP-final-project

The notebook file in this repository is the code that was used for training the BERT models. 

The models themselves were too big for GitHub, so I have uploaded them to Hugging Face at https://huggingface.co/conormackey/NLP-final-project-models

Included in the Hugging Face repo are the raw values from evlautation, graphs and charts produced during training, and misclassified tweets from each model. All of this data is organized by model into folders so it is easier for you to parse. 

I have limited space on my machine, so a mix of the data generated in this project was saved locally and in my Google Drive. I believe everything in my project is in this repo or the Hugging Face repo, but I may have made a mistake. So if you find anything to be missing, please reach out to me ASAP at mackey.c@northeastern.edu so I can provide it for you.
